syncnapsis installation guide
=============================

This a short instruction on "how to install syncnapsis?".
I won't go into detail too deeply so I assume you have some experience in configuring development environments...

preparation
===========

Before we can acutally start with syncnapsis specific stuff we want to be well prepared... 
The following list contains all the stuff you will have to download and since we do not necessarily wait for a download each time we process to the next step in this guide I included this so we can donwload all the stuff before we start and while we do the first steps.
The versions posted here are those versions I worked with by 2013-05-06. Please forgive me if I might forget to update versions in future but newer versions should mostly work...
